Background Information
What is geothermal energy? Geothermal is the natural heat of the Earth derived from the decay of the radioactive elements in the Earth’s crust and transferred to the subsurface by conduction and convection. 
Temperatures at the core–mantle boundary may reach over 4000 °C (7200 °F). The high temperature and pressure in Earth's interior cause some rock to melt and solid mantle to behave plastically, resulting in parts of the mantle convecting upward since it is lighter than the surrounding rock. Rock and water is heated in the crust, sometimes up to 370 °C (700 °F).
What is geothermal used for? For centuries, geothermal springs have been used for bathing, heating and cooking. But in the early 20th century people started to consider geothermal as a practical source of energy with huge potential. Geothermal energy is now used to produce electricity, to heat and cool buildings as well as for other industrial purposes like fruit and vegetable cultivation.

Problem Statement
2 parameters are important in the evaluation of geothermal potential. 
Formation Temperature: The higher the temperature at bottom, the higher the potential for Geothermal use. Despite the abundance of techniques for collecting drilling and well operation data, they do not necessarily provide the real Bottom Hole Temperature (BHT). 
Flowrate Capacity: Flowrate determines the amount of fluid that can flow naturally or be pumped through the formation or pipe. Higher permeability formations or larger diameter pipe are more viable for Geothermal purposes.

There is the belief that old (or current) oil and gas wells can be re-purposed for geothermal energy use, using the subsurface infrastructure already in place plus the data already collected during the life of the well.

We are provided with relevant well data from 2 Oil & Gas basins: 
-	Duvernay in Alberta, Canada
-	Eaglebine in Texas, USA 

The information includes;
•	Well logs in LAS format
•	Well header, drilling, completion and production data
•	BHT and DST Temperature measurements
•	Calculated synthetic true temperature

The goal of this project is to evaluate what wells are showing geothermal potential and based on those, which areas deserve further evaluation.  The goal of this notebook is to develop a machine learning model to predict the real bottom hole temperature and determine a subset of available wells showing the most potential for geothermal energy use.
